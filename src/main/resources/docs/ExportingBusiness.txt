1. Identify the type of goods you're exporting
The type of goods being shipped plays a large role in selecting the right mode of transport.

Depending on the market you're sending your product to, there may be limitations on the transport available. You may need several modes of transport for a single shipment.

Depending on the type of products you're exporting, you might need special treatment such as cold chain custody.

Sea freight is significantly cheaper per carton than airfreight. It is a viable option for us as long as vessel schedules are maintained.

Example – Cheap transport costs Australian business
An Australian exporter of high-end, fresh seafood products received an order from a customer in Asia, a top sushi restaurant in the region.

To increase their own margins, the distributor used the cheapest transport available. Poor handling of the containers caused damage, increased temperatures and exposed the fresh fish to bacteria. The restaurant owner rejected the unsafe and poor quality product.

The exporter had to wear the full cost of the shipment and lost this buyer as a customer. The damage to their reputation in the broader market resulted in them losing more buyers and the contract with the restaurant.

Perishable items
For perishable items you will need specialised transport methods. These goods are sensitive to temperature fluctuations. They need precise control of their environment through the whole transport process.

Temperature-controlled or 'reefer' containers:

maintain the right temperature range
preserve quality of perishable goods.
Fragile items
Fragile items also need special attention and care during transport to prevent damage. Select a mode of transport with gentle handling and which minimises vibrations. This can greatly reduce the likelihood of damage.

Tip – Consider climate impacts
Consider the change of climate from Australia to the destination country. Consider whether your product can withstand sudden changes in humidity or temperature during transport.

Assess the climatic conditions along the shipping route and the destination. This will help you determine appropriate packaging, insulation and transport methods.

Logistics solutions for online exporters
Shipping products to a target market and consumers can be challenging. Regardless of your distribution model, tailor your shipment solution to your circumstances and customers.

Direct shipment
When using direct shipment you'll need to fill purchase orders for each overseas customer order.

It's a good option if you're testing a new market or want to deal directly with consumers and retain control over your brand.

However, direct shipment is not practical for some products or markets. This may be due to unreliable postal and customs clearance processes for parcels.

Direct shipment is not possible at all for some items, such as food.

Pros
Full control over stock
No need for a distributor
May take advantage of tax-free threshold in some countries
Cons
High freight and labour costs
Risk of product loss and damage
Longer consumer wait times
Third-party logistics fulfilment warehousing
Many exporters and importers have warehouses to store products until they are ready to ship or sell to customers.

As part of the shipping process you may need to use a third party warehouse.

This is the storage of products that have arrived at their destination. It's also referred to as 3PL, or 3rd party logistics warehousing.

The goods remain in storage until they are ready for transportation to the buyer. This may be a bulk delivery of the full shipment, or separation into smaller units sent to the end customer.

3PL warehousing is most often used by e-commerce businesses. Most 3PL services can be integrated seamlessly into a business’s e‑commerce platform. However, business owners should be aware of the diverse range of cost structures.

Your freight forwarder can assist with International warehousing contacts. Refer to the  International Forwarders & Customs Brokers Association of Australia’s (IFCBAA) Member Directory portal to find a freight forwarder.

Pros
Cheaper bulk shipment
Quicker delivery speed
Scalable services
Cons
Requires long-range sales predictions
Higher risk of waste if product expires
High storage fee if turnover is slow
Free Trade Zone
To promote overseas e‑commerce, some countries have established regions known as Free Trade Zones.

Under this model, you can send containers into a Free Trade Zone, and get:

certificate-free, tax-free thresholds
bonded policies for selected items.
If you use this method you need to find a local service provider to manage shipment and last mile logistics.

Pros
Lower logistics and taxation costs
Fewer import regulations on some items
Faster consumer delivery speeds
Cons
Risk of policies and regulations changing
Potential loss of control over stock
No ability to facilitate returns
With online exporting, you need to ensure the whole shipping experience is well managed. Ask external partners about transit time, reliability, and delivery to make sure they can provide a satisfying consumer experience.

2. Check the destination
Destination is another crucial factor to consider when choosing a shipping method.

The method normally used when exporting can vary depending on:

the distance to the destination
the regulations there.
Infrastructure
It’s important to check the destination's transport and logistics infrastructure. This includes:

ports
airports
road networks.
Their efficiency and capacity can greatly affect how your goods are handled and delivered.

Regulations
When exporting, it’s also essential to research and follow:

customs requirements
import restrictions
documentation needed for the specific destination.
Obeying regulations is crucial to avoid delays, penalties or refusal of entry for your goods.

3. Weigh up cost versus security
Balance cost-effectiveness against your specific requirements when transporting cargo overseas.

More expensive methods offer faster delivery or better security for valuable items.

It’s also best to negotiate and work with freight service providers to explore possible cost-saving measures. These may include:

bulk discounts
contract rates
freight consolidation services.
This can help reduce overall shipping expenses.

4. Research transit times
Expected transit time is important to consider, particularly for time-sensitive goods. Different transport methods have different transit times. Air travel is the fastest. It’s also usually more expensive.

Export shipping by sea can be slower but it costs less. This may suit products with a longer shelf life.

Assess whether the delivery timeframe aligns with your customers' expectations and any contractual obligations.

5. Look for reliability
Choosing a reliable service provider ensures goods are delivered undamaged and on time.

Research the track record and reputation of freight and logistics companies. Check:

their reliability in meeting deadlines and handling shipments with care
testimonials from past customers.
Goods can be subjected to risks during transport. This includes:

mishandling
improper storage
damage caused by external factors.
Reliable service providers should:

prioritise the safe handling of shipments
protect your goods.
6. Analyse transport within the destination country
The full journey of your export shipment doesn't only involve transport from Australia to the destination country. It's also about delivery to the specific location in that country.

When considering the location of your final destination, it's important to assess how practical it is to:

transport your goods from the port to the inland destination, or
use direct air travel from Australia.
Transport from port of entry
If your final destination is deep inland, far away from the port of entry, work out the most efficient and cost-effective way to transport your goods to their final destination. In these cases, you have 2 main options: inland transport or air travel.

Inland transport involves moving your goods from the port to the inland destination using road, rail, or a combination of both. This option is suitable when the distance between the port and the final destination is manageable, and there is well-established transport infrastructure in place.

Direct air travel from Australia
Opting for air travel directly from Australia can be a viable choice if:

the final destination is located deep inland
there are logistical challenges associated with transporting goods by road or rail.
While air freight can be more expensive, it gets your goods to the final destination faster.

Comply with the applicable exporting laws and regulations to avoid potential disruptions or penalties.
